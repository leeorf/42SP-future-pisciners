# About this repository

This repository was made for the purpose of helping anyone who is going to face the *piscine* of any 42 School, in special who is applying for **42SP** (Brazil).

# Personal hint

One of 42's rules is:

> "Don't believe rumors"

And there is a reason for that. The 42 methodology is to don't make things so clear.

Because of that, it is important to notice that all of this are **assumptions**, and you guys must use as you wish and at your own responsibility.

>## Hot tip
>I found that one of the fewest resources that we can use there, is the **terminal**. So, as we are going to use terminal all the time, my advice is to **use the terminal to do the exercises"**

Here goes some useful commands that you may need: `cd`, `mv`, `rm`, `ls`, `touch`, `mkdir`, `chmod`, `chown`

## Git

During the *piscine* we are going to use Git for everything (or almost everything). So, it is a good idea to familiarize yourself with it and understand the basic commands and its workflow.

Commands such as `init`, `clone`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`, `add` can be very useful.

## Shell scripting

Shell scripting is a very extensive subject, so I am going to link some of my the material that I write while I am studying.

## vim

If you are already familiar with text editors (the place where we write our programs), know that vim is also a text editor.

But vim is a different kind of text editor, because we can use it through a CLI (command line interface) and it comes by default in Unix based systems.

Probably our favorite text editors (**VSCode** cough cough :satisfied:) won't be allowed, so it is important to take a time to understand how to work with vim.

> Here I don't know any specific exercise to practice vim. My advice is to use vim as much as you can, until you get used to it.

Some tips about vim:

- Vim has operation modes. The first ones you should be aware of are: **command** mode and **insert** mode.
	- **command**: you can enter commands that vim will execute. When you start vim this is the default mode.
	- **insert**: mode where we can actually type normally. To go from command mode to insert mode you can press `i`.

>OBS: In case you "accidentally" enter vim and don't know how to quit, don't desperate. Just press `:q` and its done. And this has happened to me already :laughing:

## C

When it comes to the traditional C programming language, you need to pay attention when doing the exercises, because in the *piscine* a lot of things are forbidden. Things like:

:x: Declaring and initializing a variable in the same line;

:x: Use `printf`;

:x: Use `for` loop;
